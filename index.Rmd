# About the Book {-}

![](img/cover-img.png)

This book covers the foundation skills necessary to start ___writing computer programs to work with data___ using modern and reproducible techniques. It requires no technical background. These materials were developed for the **INFO 201: Technical Foundations of Informatics** course taught at the [University of Washington Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/); however they have been structured to be an online resource for anyone hoping to learn to work with information using programmatic approaches.

Since 2019 there, there is a published book based on this online book,
_Programming Skills for Data Science_,
that covers broadly similar topics but differs in many details.
It is
available to UW students for free via <a
href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-skills-for/9780135159071/"
target="_blank">SafariBooksOnline</a> or <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0135133106" target="_blank">in
print</a>.

This version of the book is currently maintained by Ott Toomet, the
original is on GitHub, in [otoomet/book](https://github.com/otoomet/book).
