# What is rmarkdown?

It is a way to mix _ordinary text_ and _R code_ into a single
document.  Thereafter the document will be processed by **knitting**:
first the code is executed and replaced with output, and thereafter
the markdown rendered.

Below we describe the _iris_ dataset, collected by Fisher and Anderson
in 1930-s.  The dataset contains `r ncol(iris)` bits of information
about `r nrow(iris)` flowers of `r length(unique(iris$Species))`
different species, `r paste(unique(iris$Species), collapse=", ")`.
The relationship between length and width of the
leaves is displayed in the figure below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length, col=Species, data=iris,
     main = "Relationship between width and length of iris sepals",
     pch=16, cex=1.5,
     xlab = "Sepal width, cm", ylab = "Sepal length, cm")
legend("topright", legend = unique(iris$Species),
       col=1:3, pch=16)
```
